## My process

The first process was to markup with HTML followed with CSS styling. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<span>I'm always proud of the span tag</span>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  border-style: none;
}
```

### Continued development

I still want to improve my use of flex-box and grid.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for button styling. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flex display. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
